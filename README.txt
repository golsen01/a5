Grace Olsen, Assignment 5

I believe all aspects of this assignment have been implemented correctly.

Chris Shinn helped me understand how to code with mongo.

Note: I attempted to put a css file in my code to make my table look prettier, but the link did not work.
Since it's not required to look nice I'm just going to leave that there.
